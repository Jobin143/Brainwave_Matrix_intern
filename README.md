📚 Library Management System - SQL Task with Brainwave Matrix Solutions 📚

I recently completed a Library Management System task as part of internship from Brainwave Matrix Solutions. This project enhanced my SQL skills by designing and managing a structured database for a library.

🔍 Project Highlights:
✅ Designed and implemented a relational database using MySQL
✅ Created tables for Books, Members, and Loans with necessary constraints
✅ Inserted sample data to simulate real-world library operations
✅ Wrote queries to:
🔹 View available books and registered members
🔹 Track borrowed books with due dates
🔹 Handle book returns and member deletions efficiently

This task reinforced my database management skills and strengthened my ability to structure and query large datasets. Grateful for this opportunity to apply my learning in a practical scenario!

Looking forward to more hands-on projects in SQL, Data Analytics, and Database Management. 🚀
